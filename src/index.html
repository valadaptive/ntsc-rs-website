            <p>Other popular effects eyeball the look of VHS tapes using simple color lookup tables and overlays. ntsc-rs uses algorithms that model how NTSC transmission and VHS encoding actually work, based on algorithms developed in <a href="https://github.com/joncampbell123/composite-video-simulator/">composite-video-simulator</a>, <a href="https://github.com/zhuker/ntsc">zhuker/ntsc</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/JargeZ/ntscqt/">ntscQT</a>.</p>

            <p>ntsc-rs is written in Rust, and is multithreaded and SIMD-accelerated. Unlike other, similar effects, it can run in real time at much higher resolutions than actual NTSC footage.</p>
