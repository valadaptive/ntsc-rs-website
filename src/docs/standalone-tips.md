If you don't feel like reading the [full overview of the standalone application](../standalone-application), here's a condensed list of the extra features that it supports:

- You can drag the numeric value inputs. Dragging up or to the right increases them, and dragging down or to the left decreases them.
- The numeric value inputs in the Effect Settings pane will evaluate mathematical expressions for you.
- The volume and zoom settings support both percentages and decimal values.
- You can use Ctrl+scroll to zoom in and out of the timeline, and scroll to move around in it once zoomed in.
- Pressing space will play/pause the preview.
- You can drag and drop videos and presets into the application window. If you drop a preset onto the effect settings area, it will load the preset. If you drop presets onto the preset manager, they will be copied into the presets folder.
